# CITS3200 Project

## Project Statement

The primary objective of this project is to develop a highly efficient web application that offers engineering students a semi-automated course study planner. This course planner will provide a straightforward method for structuring a student's academic journey, accompanied by precise instructions on the following: 

 - Course regulations 

- Essential course units  

- Unit prerequisites 

The application will work with the student's personal preferences to design a course plan adhering to all applicable rules. This plan will visually illustrate which units should be done each year and each semester of the individual degree. As a result, the student will receive a clear and optimal course plan that ensures degree completion within the designated timeframe.  

## Skills/Resources

### Web Developement

Our decision to utilize HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for the web application's interface was both strategic and practical.The team  developed proficiency in core web technologies, as the team has all completed the Agile Web Developement Unit (CITS3403). This foundation meant we could immediately dive into development without the need for a learning curve associated with more complex frameworks like Angular or React. Moreover, considering the project's tight timeline, it was imperative to leverage our existing skills rather than invest time upskilling on new languages or frameworks. This approach not only optimized our workflow but also ensured we delivered a high-quality product within the stipulated timeframe.  

### Database Management

For database management, our team unanimously chose SQLite, a decision driven by multiple factors. Foremost, our collective experience with SQLite in both the Relational Database and Agile Web Development units rendered us well-acquainted with its functionalities and advantages. SQLite's lightweight nature, ease of use, and built-in compatibility with Python presented a seamless choice for our requirements. Furthermore, its effortless integration with Flask—a framework our team is proficient in—further solidified our decision. By leveraging SQLite, we could capitalize on our pre-existing knowledge and ensure efficient, reliable database management for our web application.
