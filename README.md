# Prerequisite Pathways Visualization Website

## Project Overview

Engineering units often have a number of unit prerequisites. Study plans show the prerequisites and the plans are designed to make sure the prerequisites are met. However, students often take units out of sequence and then realize they have not completed a prerequisite, which can impact their academic progression. The Prerequisite Pathways Visualization Website aims to address this issue by providing an intuitive and interactive platform for students to visualize unit prerequisite pathways.

This project utilizes Flask, a Python web framework, to create a dynamic and user-friendly website. When a student selects a specific unit in their study plan, the website will highlight the prerequisite relationships (both forward and backward) between the selected unit and others. This visualization will empower students to make informed decisions about their course selections and ensure they meet the necessary prerequisites.
